The Maintainer Manifesto is written in hand-crafted HTML, CSS, and Markdown.  It is generated using [Zola](https://getzola.org), and developed [on GitHub](https://github.com/maintainermanifesto/maintainermanifesto.org).
The cute OctoCat corner is by [Tim Holman](https://tholman.com/github-corners/).
